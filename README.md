# Music Convert

Just a simple zsh script to convert/copy my music from other formats to opus
using ffmpeg.

See the script source for notes on usage.

This is pretty much built for my specific use-case, so you'll probably want to
modify if you want to do things differently.

Now makes use of [icu](https://icu.unicode.org)'s uconv for making
cross-filesystem filenames more friendly.
